                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>LastLight ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
                    explains how LastLight handles information when you use our iOS application.</p>
                <p><strong>In short: LastLight does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any of your personal data. All
                        data processing happens locally on your device.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h3>Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
                <p>LastLight does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information, including but
                    not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your name, email address, or contact information</li>
                    <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
                    <li>Usage analytics or app behavior data</li>
                    <li>Crash reports or diagnostic data</li>
                    <li>Your precise location history or tracking data</li>

            <div class="privacy-section">
                <h3>Location Data</h3>
                <p>LastLight requires location information to calculate accurate sunset and twilight times for your
                    area. Here's how we handle location data:</p>

                <h4>How Location Data is Used</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Location coordinates are used solely to calculate sun times for your area</li>
                    <li>Location data is processed entirely on your device</li>
                    <li>We do not store, transmit, or share your location with any third parties</li>
                    <li>Location coordinates are only used at the moment of calculation and are not retained</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Location Methods</h4>
                <p>You can choose from three location determination methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Device Location:</strong> Uses your iPhone's GPS to determine your current location.
                        This is the most accurate method. Location permissions are requested through iOS's standard
                        permission dialog.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automatic (IP-Based):</strong> Estimates your location based on your IP address using a
                        third-party service (ipapi.co). This method provides city-level accuracy without requiring
                        location permissions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Manual Address:</strong> Allows you to enter any address or location manually. The
                        address is geocoded to coordinates using Apple's geocoding service.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Location Permissions</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you choose Device Location, iOS will prompt you to grant location access</li>
                    <li>You can grant "While Using the App" or "Always" permission</li>
                    <li>"Always" permission enables background updates to keep your widgets current</li>
                    <li>You can change or revoke location permissions at any time in iOS Settings</li>
                    <li>If you prefer not to grant location permissions, you can use the IP-Based or Manual Address
                        methods instead</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section">
